  <section>
    <h3>1. Project Title &amp; Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Help Desk Ticket Analytics System</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Help Desk Ticket Analytics System is a project designed to turn raw IT support ticket data into actionable insights. By analyzing and identifying the most frequent recurring issues, the system highlights opportunities to improve processes, reduce workload, and enhance overall support efficiency. This project demonstrates how data-driven decision making can transform everyday IT operations into more proactive and effective services.</p>

    <h3>2. Vision, Mission, and Strategy Alignment</h3>

    <h4>Personal Mission Connection</h4>
    <p>This project supports my personal mission of empowering people with technology by taking complex help desk ticket data and turning it into clear, actionable insights. Just as I strive to make technology more accessible for everyday users, this project demonstrates my ability to bridge technical analysis with practical solutions that improve IT support services.</p>

    <h4>Vision Alignment</h4>
    <p>My long-term vision is to work in a role where I combine technology with education and community impact. This project is a step toward that <em>future</em> by showcasing how data analytics can be used to improve processes, reduce barriers, and make technology a stronger asset for both individuals and organizations. By delivering a practical analytics system, I not only strengthen my technical portfolio but also build a model of how technology can be used to anticipate problems and support people more effectively.</p>

    <h4>Strategy Goal Support</h4>
    <p>This project advances my strategic goals in three ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> By presenting findings in clear visualizations and a professional case study, I will practice turning technical results into language that stakeholders can understand and act on.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Analytics Development:</strong> The work directly builds my skills in analysis, visualization, and storytelling with data – skills that will later be reinforced through certifications in analytics and dashboarding.</li>
      <li><strong>Leveraging Technical Strengths:</strong> This project channels my technical strengths into a structured, real-world project that aligns with my broader career roadmap. It demonstrates how I can transform raw data into valuable insights, which is a critical step toward roles in IT, data analysis, and beyond.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Business Case &amp; Justification</h3>

    <h4>Professional Value</h4>
    <p>This project strengthens my professional profile by giving me a tangible example of how I can apply data analytics to real IT problems. While many candidates may list technical skills on a resume, this project demonstrates those skills in action through a clear deliverable: identifying recurring IT issues and presenting solutions. It also adds depth to my portfolio, making me more competitive for roles in IT, data analysis, or technical support that require both analytical and problem-solving capabilities.</p>

    <h4>Personal Value</h4>
    <p>On a personal level, this project allows me to take ownership of my growth by transforming a challenge I’ve experienced firsthand at the Help Desk into a structured solution. The process will not only increase my confidence in tackling complex data problems but also give me the satisfaction of turning messy, overwhelming information into something organized and impactful. Beyond academics, it empowers me to imagine how analytics could one day improve operations at my workplace or even inspire the creation of a dedicated IT analytics function.</p>

    <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
    <p>Through this project, I expect to improve my ability to collect, clean, and analyze real-world data using tools that are relevant across industries. I will gain hands-on practice in turning data into visualizations and recommendations, a skill set that connects technical work to business decision-making. Additionally, the project provides a safe space to practice explaining insights clearly – building communication skills that will be essential for future presentations, team collaboration, and stakeholder engagement.</p>
